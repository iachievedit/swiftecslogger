# SwiftEcsLogger

## What?

`SwiftEcsLogger`is a simplified logger for server-side or command-line Swift applications.  

## Why?

Perhaps the functionality already exists in another package, but every logger I looked at had emojis and unnecessary complexity.  Furthermore, they didn't (seem to) have a straightforward manner to generate ECS-compatible logs suitable for ingesting into Elasticsearch.

## How?

### Adding to `Package.swift`

### Adding to Application
